# ListMagic
Get every word from a domain and make your own targeted subdomain wordlist. Works with amass to enumerate subdomains, then grabs every word before the dot as far as to a 5th level subdomain. Combine this tool with massdns, dnscan or anything of your choice!

## Couple know-before's:
- You **need** amass, which can be installed with the "dep.sh" file.
- Fast, but it depends on the target.
- You can CTRL + C on your terminal when amass is taking too long, it will simply skip amass and generate the wordlist.
- You can supply a domain list and it will still generate a wordlist from the supplied list.

## INSTALL

```
git clone https://github.com/weston2337/ListMagic.git

chmod +x dep.sh

chmod +x listmagic.sh

./dep.sh
```

## USAGE

Enjoy hacking! :)
